# Lab 0: Setting up your environment

## Quickstart: Visual Studio Code

Setting up your environment before Starting Lab 1.

1. When you are ready to start a lab: (1) start Visual Stuido Code, (2) go to File->Open Menu, and (3) open the **folder** for the lab. For example, to work on `lab-1`, open the folder `01-model-training` from Visual Studio Code. This will ensure that the current working directory for the quickstart’s starting python file will set correctly.

2. In VS code, when you first open the starting python file for a lab, use Select Interpreter command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and select the azure_automl as your interpreter.

```
Note > All training model(01-model-training) are located at 'C:\azure-machine-learning-service-labs-master\azure-machine-learning-service-labs-master\starter-artifacts\visual-studio-code' this location inside the virtual machine.
```
